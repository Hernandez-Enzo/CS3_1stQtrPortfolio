List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with twoto five sentences.

1. Arithmetic Operations in JS - This topic is all about the basic mathematical operations of +, -, *, /, and %. + is used for addition (not to be confused with + as concatenation). - is used for subtraction. * is used for multiplication. / is used for division, and % is used for remainder. There are also operations like ++, --, and ** which refer to increment, decrement, and exponentiation, respectively. 

2. If-Else Structures in JS - This topic is all about if and else, which are conditional structures. If follows the format of if(condition){}, which tests if the condition is met. If so, it will follow through the block of code in the if parameters. Similarly, Else is used right after If and doesn't require a condition, as it follows if the if condition is false. Else can also be added onto another If (in the form of else if (){}), which adds another condition that it has to check before accomplishing the plain Else. 

3. Variable Declaration in JS - This topic is all about the variable declaration statements let, var, and const. let and var are very similar, with var being able to be both re-declared and re-assigned, and let only being able to be re-assigned. const is a fixed variable that cannot be re-assigned or re-declared. var is also the only function scoped variable, meaning it works when used anywhere in the function. let and const are both block scoped, meaning it only works when you use the variable inside the specific block of code. 

4. Switch Structure in JS - This topic is all about switch statements, which are conditional structures. Switch is used with statements case, default, and break. Switch itself follows the format of switch(variable){case: ... break; ... default: ...} which do a block of code based on the variable, and if it fits the condition. The conditions are found in the case statements which will do the block of code if condition is found true. Default is the original value with no case matches. Break is what ends the switch block right after doing the case that was found true; without break, the function will also check the other cases. 

5. Loop Control Structures in JS - This topic is all about the three Loop Statements, while, do while, and for. All three follow the simple rule of, if the condition is true, it will loop back to the start of the code. while statement is a pre-condition loop, which checks the condition before starting the block of code. The do while statement, on the other hand, is a post-condition loop, which checks the condition after running the block of code. The for loop is a pre-condition loop following the general structure of for(initialization; condition; condition update).


List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  

1. Assigning Variables with Other Operations - This was part of one of the questions that I got wrong on the LT1 (Question 7. Which of the following assigns x a 'true' value?). I personally got this wrong since I couldn't understand the other options (x = 3 == 3 and x = 3 == "3"). I was confused on how comparing a value works in the same line as a declaration. 

2. && and || when assigning variables - This was part of a question in LT1 (Question 16. Which will be the result of the statements, if a=false, b=true, and c=true?). I got confused on this statement "let result = a && !(b||c);". When I inputted the values, I got "let result = false && false", which I thought would become true since both values are the same.

3. I/O Statements in HTML - This is generally a topic I'm not that well versed in yet since I have yet to memorize the statements required in HTML like span id, document.getElementByID, input id, and so on. I get a bit confused since JS is a case-sensitive programming language, meaning, it is crucial to know the exact look of all the statements. Other than this, the statements are also usually a bit long, meaning a longer thing to memorize.

4. Functions in JS - This was part of a few questions in LT2, but it was specifically in Question 21, where they were asking about "Which of the following are valid JavaScript function parameter names?". I think that I was just a bit under prepared since I couldn't remember which type of statements weren't allowed. I forgot about "_count" since I thought parameter names couldn't start with non-letter characters.

5. Arrow Functions - This was part of one question in LT2, namely Question 14, where it asked for "Which arrow function correctly returns the square of x?". I did not know the formats that arrow functions used, which eventually led to me choosing the right answer. There were three ways to make an arrow function, x => x*x, (x) => x*x, and (x) => {return x*x;}.


Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
1. I believe that I should read about each function, even just a little bit, since I've noticed that most of these topics/mistakes could've been easily solved if I knew something about it. I will read LG's and watch ma'am's video lessons and also try applying it myself in actual code. I will test out things that I do not understand and find what the results will be for different situations.


In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

Effective
1. Exercises (Graded and Non-graded) - I thoroughly enjoyed working on all the exercises given to us since it taught me how to apply the statements in code. It's a great way for us to practice making code, similar to the exams. It teaches us how to read the pseudo code and how to build it into code.
2. Speed Tests - I enjoyed making my own code and racing against my table. It is a great way to start applying what we've learned in class with an additional incentive of bonus points. It is also good for understanding how statements work and how to apply it in your own code.

Ineffective
1. Diagnostic Test - Personally, I feel that having the diagnostic test be graded takes away from the whole thing of "diagnostic". It's meant to test our abilities in what we've learned, but if its graded, its practically become a quiz. I think that it would be much better as a bonus point system where if students get 9-10, they receive bonus points. I do think keeping it is good, but the system used in itself is a bit off.
2. Kahoot - I enjoyed racing with my classmates, but due to the time limit, especially if you're not well-versed in the topic yet, it was hard to think what could the answer be. I do enjoy the times when ma'am teaches us about it after the question. However, Ma'am's pacing is also slightly fast.
